# AR Experiment (https://de-gouveia.eu/ar)
---

An augmented reality personal website.

This is the result of some learning of 3D modeling, react, three.js and react-three.

## TODO

* Fix issue with jest, which prevents tests from running
* Create tests
* Add more complex 3D modelled meshes and interactions
* Attempt marker tracking solutions - this seems to be not supported at all at the moment
